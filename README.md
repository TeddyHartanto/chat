Summary

This web application is for NUS students to pour their hearts out anonymously to each other in a conversation, and hopefully both party gain some insight, advice or support regarding their problems.

Motivation

Some people may feel uncomfortable with sharing their feelings/problems/thoughts to their friends. This is due to some reasons, including but not limited to the fear of being judged. They still want to seek some advice or gain some insight, but they want their identity undisclosed. This web-based chat application will enable them to do exactly that.

Planned Features

User Stories

As a user who is uncomfortable with sharing my personal problem to my close ones, I want to be able to chat anonymously to someone who would listen to me so I can relieve my anxiety.
As a user, I want to be able to report people who behave inappropriately in a conversation so that I am protected from potential unethical behavior..
As a user, I want to be able to start a new conversation so that I can chat with another person if I don’t like the current person I’m talking to.
As a user, I want to be able to identify the user I am talking to if both of us click and both of us agree to identify one another so that we can make friends.
As a user, I want to be able to view my chat history so that i can read through them just in case i wanted to do so.
As a user, I want to be able to search for keywords in my chat so that i can return to that particular section of conversation if i need to.
